Contributions:

Jessi:
Drafted the Runtime UI notebook with initial feedforward control (using scipy) and PID control algorithm (position): used 06.02 notebook template and PID using python yield statement. Created Review UI notebook using information from: 06.03 notebook template.

Ana: 
Created Protocol UI notebook with appropriate requirements from project guidelines: used 06.03 notebook template. Enhanced feedforward control algorithm by incoorperating cvxpy library and altered PID control algorithm (velocity).
