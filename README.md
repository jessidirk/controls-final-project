## Protocol UI

## Runtime UI

## Review UI


## Contributions:

Jessi: 

* Drafted the Runtime UI notebook with initial feedforward control (using scipy) and PID control algorithm (position): used 06.02 notebook template and PID using python yield statement

* Tuned the PID control gain values to optimize the simulation (hardware malfunction)

* Created Review UI notebook using information from 06.03 notebook template.

Ana:

* Created Protocol UI notebook with appropriate requirements from project guidelines: used 06.03 notebook template. 

* Created feedforward control algorithm by using cvxpy library and PID control algorithm (velocity). 

* Debugged Runtime UI work function and widgets.
