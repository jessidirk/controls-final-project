#The PCR Thermal Cycler should be capable of performing two PCR amplification protocols at the same time. The specifications for each amplification protocol are as follows:

Start. The amplification protocol starts at ambient temperature.
Initial Denaturation. The denaturation setpoint will be a value in the range from 92-98 deg C and for a period of 60-120 seconds determined by the user. The same temperature setpoint will apply to all subsequent denaturation cycles.
PCR Thermal cycles. The user should be able to specify up to 30 PCR cycles. (To save time, you only need to test performance for only 3 cycles.) Each cycle consists of
Annealing. A user determined temperature between 50 deg C and 65 deg C for user determined period from 30 to 120 seconds.
Extension. A user determined temperature of 68-72 deg C for a period from 30-180 seconds.
Denaturation. At the same temperature as the initial denaturation for a user determined period of 30-120 seconds.
Final Extension. The protocol finishes with a final extension step that can be user determined from 30-300 seconds.
Finish. Following the final extension, the temperature should return to ambient temperature and present a message to the user indicating completion.
